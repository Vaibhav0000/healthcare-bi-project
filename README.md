  <em>Data-driven insights into U.S. healthcare drug use patterns, built for strategic public health decision-making.</em>
</p>

## 📌 Summary

A comprehensive analytics project exploring drug use across healthcare settings in the United States — Emergency (ED), Inpatient (IP), and Outpatient (OP). This project merges **hospital-level drug usage data** with **socioeconomic census data** to identify key trends, vulnerable demographics, and geographical hotspots.

---

## 🎯 Real-World Scenario

Simulating a real-world public health research scenario, this project answers:

- 👥 **Who** is most impacted by drug use?
- 📍 **Where** are the highest-risk regions?
- 🧬 **What socioeconomic factors** contribute to these trends?

---

## 🚀 Key Outcomes

✔️ Over **60%** of drug-related incidents occur in **Emergency Departments**  
✔️ **Opioids & Cannabis** are the most reported substances  
✔️ **Rural counties** and **youth populations** are highly vulnerable  
✔️ **West Virginia** and **New Mexico** lead in per capita incidents, correlating with low income
