# Healthcare Drug Use Analytics Platform

## 🔍 Project Overview

A data-driven investigation into drug use patterns across U.S. healthcare settings (ED, IP, OP) to uncover key demographic, geographic, and socioeconomic insights. Built to support data-backed interventions and resource allocation.

## 🧠 Real-World Scenario

This project simulates a real-world public health research initiative. We sourced healthcare facility-level drug use data and paired it with U.S. census-based socioeconomic data to analyze:

* Who is affected most by drug use?
* Where are the hotspots?
* What social and economic factors correlate with these trends?

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **Google Colab**: Data wrangling, transformation, validation
* **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards and storyboards
* **Excel**: Initial data review

## 📊 Key Dashboards & Insights

* **Overview Dashboard**: Drug-related visits per setting across the U.S.
* **Demographic Analysis**: Opioid and cannabis usage disproportionately affecting youth and rural populations
* **Geographic Trends**: West Virginia & New Mexico as top states per capita; socioeconomic correlation evident
* **Facility-Level Patterns**: A handful of facilities account for a large share of drug-related visits

## 📈 Validated Insights

1. **Over 60%** of all drug-related incidents occurred in Emergency Departments.
2. **Opioids and Cannabis** were the top reported drugs.
3. **Rural counties and youth** showed higher per capita drug-related visits.
4. **West Virginia and New Mexico** had the highest per capita cases, linked to low median income.
